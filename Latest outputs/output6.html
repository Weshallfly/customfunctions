   Beshear said during a 5 p.m. press conference on May 17 that he expected the Kentucky death toll to "potentially rise."

   “This was a devastatingly strong tornado that tore through a subdivision in the middle of the night and that is the worst type of natural disaster," he said.

   The tornadoes came amid a severe weather outbreak with preliminary reports of tornadoes in Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and even New Jersey.

   "Politics has no place in responding to national disasters like this one, and for the two events that we've already had this year, we've seen a White House and a FEMA organization that has performed well and has done what we've asked,” he said.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Kentucky victims range in age from 76 to 25
  </h2>
  <p>
   Beshear listed the sex and age of those who died in the Kentucky storms. The oldest is a 76-year-old man, the youngest a 25-year-old man, both from Laurel County, a community of 63,000 people south of Lexington in the Appalachian region.
  </p>
  <p>
   The tornado also killed a 48-year-old and a 51-year-old woman from Laurel County. Beshear didn't know the ages of three other individuals who died. The other confirmed fatalities are individuals in their 60s and 70s.
  </p>
  <p>
   At least 10 people are in critical condition and others are receiving medical care, Beshear said.
  </p>

   "All our efforts are still focused on searching and rescuing anyone who might still be in danger," the governor said. "And tending to those who are still fighting for their lives."

   Kentucky tornado had powerful winds, possibly up to 165 mph
  </h2>
  <p>
   Beshear said he was awaiting more information on the strength of the Kentucky tornado.
  </p>
  <p>
   The information he received from the National Weather Service, which he said was relayed to him "secondhand," is that the tornado was an EF3 when it went through the Somerset community.

   An EF3 tornado has winds of 136 to 165 mph.

   She and her family huddled against a wall in a small portion of the family room that’s underground.

   When it passed, Deaton looked around, saw her family was safe, and I said, ‘There is nothing in this house that I can’t leave behind.'”
  </p>

   When the family tried to leave, though, they found they were trapped because they couldn’t get through the garage door or the back door.

   As she was rushed by other family members to vehicles and taken to safety, she couldn’t see the neighborhood she’d lived in since the 80s.

  <p>
   Then she returned to it during the daylight of Saturday morning.
  </p>
  <p>
   “It broke my heart,” Deaton said as she stifled a sob.
  </p>
  <p>
   She loved this neighborhood by the London-Corbin airport, loved the quiet street where she walked her dog.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now, her clothes were being stacked in the back of an SUV and several cars sat in her front lawn.

   “We don’t even know whose those are,” she said.

   Deaton placed her hands over her mouth as she looked across the hills of trees reaching toward the sky with no leaves and houses exposed to their beams.

   “I’m just believing that, yes it’s changed, but I know a God that restores, so that’s where we’re at,” she said.
